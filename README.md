## üéØ Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### 1. State Management

**Challenge:** Managing complex form state with multiple field types and properties.
**Solution:** Implemented a structured state management system using React's useState and custom hooks, with TypeScript interfaces ensuring type safety.

### 2. Real-Time Preview

**Challenge:** Maintaining synchronization between the builder and preview panels.
**Solution:** Created a shared state context that updates the preview component whenever form structure changes.

### 3. Local Storage Integration

**Challenge:** Efficiently storing and retrieving complex form structures.
**Solution:** Implemented JSON serialization/deserialization with proper type checking and error handling for robust storage management.

### 4. Form Validation

**Challenge:** Creating dynamic validation rules for different field types.
**Solution:** Leveraged Zod's schema building capabilities to generate validation rules based on field properties.
